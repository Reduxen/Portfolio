        <p>Inspired by platformers like Celeste, the idea behind Shimmer Of Light was to make a responsive, quick pace
            platformer with a high skill ceiling. With one special ability that would allow interesting interactions
            between mechanics. Right away from the start it was certain that this ability would be to bring background
            elements to the foreground to use them as platforms. Unity was chosen for this project, becuase of its great
            support for 2D projects. </p>

        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <div>
                <p>Naturally, with such a game, movement was the first thing to get right. I started with some basic
                    character animations, since I wanted to have a visual anchor while programming the movement. With
                    that
                    done I started the actual movement code. While Unity's rigidbody is great, I find it very
                    unsatisfying
                    for movement. Because of this I avoided using forces and instead set the velocity of the character
                    directly, which meant acceleration had to be finely controlled via code. I also programmed my own
                    air
                    drag and friction, since Unity's solution didn't give me enough control. This lead me to a movement
                    system which I could adjust very finely. </p>
                <p>Some measures were also taken to support the player:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The charcters jump is executed even if the player pressed the button a few ms before landing.
                    </li>
                    <li>A boost jump is also done if the player pressed the jump button even after a platform stopped
                        moving</li>
                    <li>And if the player switches the daytime, while simultaneously jumping the two actions are
                        executed in the
                        right order, which allows jumping out of a 2 block high dirt prison (this is a high skill level
                        move and
                        is not necessary to complete the game, only for collectibles).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <h2>The camera dilemma</h2>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <div>
                <p>One of the earlier problems I encountered is where the camera should go. The game is fairly far
                    zoomed in, which doesn't leave much space for the intended fast paced platforming. A simple solution
                    would be to contain every level to a single screen. This , however, would feel claustrophobic and
                    would have restricted the level design greatly. Another simple solution would be to just have the
                    camera follow the player . This unfortunately leads to a number of problems: The level designer
                    would never know what the player actually sees, since the player could be anywhere, which hinders
                    the level designer to lead the player to the exit or the solution. Another problem with this is that
                    platforming is really hard and feels inconsistend with a moving camera.</p>
                <p>So I opted for a hybrid solution, which is also very flexible for level iteration: The levels are
                    contained in a screen box which has a set size. The camera can move freely in said screen boxes, but
                    tries to keep the player centered . This was a great solution, in level design you always know where
                    the camera will be and you have the flexibility to create long, big levels. Additionaly camera
                    smoothing was implemented. This gives greater orientation, especially when moving between screen
                    boxes</p>
            </div>

        <h2>Levels</h2>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <div>
                <p>One of the earliest sketches for a level was a very simple idea. A level containing glass and dirt
                    tiles.
                    The dirt tiles would have their collisions
                    enabled at night and the glass tiles have their collision enabled at day. This makes the player have
                    to not only jump precisely, but also switch the daytime at the right moment. </p>
                <p>There is one problem with levels like this one: It is way too hard for a beginner. So I made a list
                    of all the mechanics and interactions between them and rated them on how hard they were. Based on
                    that rating, I crafted levels which would teach the player each skill they needed chronologically.
                    Each mechanic is introduced slowly and with a low risk of death, so that the player can experiment.
                    Then the mechanic is explored and first interactions with other mechanics are introduced. Lastly the
                    player's skills are tested with a high risk vs reward. This feels great and based on playtesters
                    experiences it feels rewarding, which is exactly what I had in mind.</p>

        <h2>Happy Accidents</h2>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <div>
                <p>Unity's 2D collision system just prevents any rigidbody to cross its outline, which means you can
                    enter the collision volume and move inside of it. I could have just killed the player once that
                    happened, but this would be very annoying and unituitive to play. So I left it in place and
                    integrated it into the game. This lead to some interesting levels where the playing person has to
                    switch up his approach to the game. It also brought about my favourite mechanic; The dirt prision as
                    mentioned above.</p>
                <p>To be able to escape such a prision some extra measures had to be taken in the movement code, as
                    explained above. With the extra measures taken to ensure consistenty when jumping out of a dirt
                    prision, this also was integrated into the game. These are optional and not part of the main game,
                    but are great for veteran platformers and speedrunners alike.</p>
