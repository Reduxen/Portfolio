        <p>All On Cardboard is a lighthearted flying game where you fly trough toy-like worlds, race rollercoasters,
          slot cars or just look cool doing stunts. Speed and stunts are rewarded and can even be chained together to
          create combos. There is one hook though... Your plane is made out of cardboard, it doesn't have it's own motor.
          So you'll need to find other ways to keep your plane flying!
          The levels are inspired by my own childhood and brought to life with the magic of UE4.</p>
        <p>With this project I again wanted to do as many things myself as possible. Thus, all models were created in Blender
          and textured by hand drawing textures in Krita using a Wacom Tablet. The Foliage I am especially proud of, since all models and textures were also done by me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made multiple levels for this game. In the lobby level, you fly a plane through a one family house in a safe environment and can learn the mechanics.
          Every room in  the house has a landing strip. Landing your plane there lets you choose a level from the room, but not every room is unlocked from the start!
          Levels are themed around POIs in the House. This is the part of the game, where you compete in races or
          challenges, like racing rollercoasters or slot cars. Competing in these will earn you stars, which unlock new planes, which in turn makes you able to enter new rooms!
          If you want a more relaxing experience, there are also some fun things to do and explore in the lobby.
