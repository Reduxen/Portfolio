        <p>Mercy Break is a Multiplayer Shooter for up to 8 players. You are stranded on an island in a free
          for all battle for the top of the leaderboard.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the Battle Royal genre, the game starts with every player having no gear.
          You have to search the abandoned city for weapons, ammunition and medical supplies.
          You can enter every building to search for loot, blow your way through walls and fences or scout the open
          construction site for loot.</p>
        <p>Once you are thoughorly equipped, you go on the hunt for other players.
          Getting a kill not only rewards you points and money, but also steals a percentage of the money from the
          killed player.
          Afterwards you can also loot their equipment.</p>

        <p>But don't worry when you get killed! You will keep some of your money and get a small amount of money as a
          bonus.
          With this you can buy your way back into the game and get your revenge! Shops are in every players spawn
          aswell as on the map.</p>

          Explosives and destructibles are scattered throughout the map for the possibility of tactical plays.
          Two powerful snipers are also placed in barricaded gas stations. They are only accessible by blowing up the
          gas station, which will alert the other players to converge on you.
