            Mercy Break was my second game project using Unreal Engine 4 and my most ambitious solo project so far.
            I went through most of the game development cycle while working on this project, since I wanted to build as
            many things from the ground up as possible.
            I not only learned UE4 and Blueprints, but also modelling, sculpting, rigging and texturing, learned
            valuable lessons in UI & UX and learned about networking & the Steam API.
        </p>
        <h2>A Solid Start</h2>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <div>
                <p>I went into this project knowing I wanted to make a 3rd person shooter similar to others in the
                    Battle Royal Genre,
                    but with local lobbies, as to be able to play against your friends.
                    The lobbies were also supposed to be customizable, so you could change most parameters of the game.
                </p>
                <p>I kicked the project off around 2016-2017 by adding very basic Networking capabilities to the 3rd
                    person template from UE4, using the Steam-API and Blueprints.
                    Once multiplayer was working and my friends could join the server over Steam, I added a character
                    model and some weapons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a naked (but family friendly!) high poly model for the player character.
                    For my first ever time sculpting, I think it turned out pretty well!
                    Once I had the model retopologized, clothed and unwrapped, I added textures in Substance Painter.
                    Eventually I got the character rigged and working with Unreal's 3rd person character.
                    I used an anim set I found online for the animations.

        </div>
        <p>With that in place, weapons were next. After adding some basic Blueprint logic I went on to create some
            weapon models in Blender:</p>

            With the addition of a simple system for the loot, a whitebox level and some friends the game could be
            tested at this point.
            Playtesting early on was important for me, that way I could figure out metrics for the level and also adjust
            balance as we go.

        <h2>Building the Game</h2>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p>
                With the framework in place, it came to producing the rest of the game.
                I redesigned the entire UI to be modern, slick-ish and added a drag and drop inventory system.
                The inventory system would serve to loot/buy equipment, see weapon statistics, heal oneself or drop
                explosives.
                Getting the inventory working with networking, while multiple players could access the same lootbox was
                probably the most challenging part of this project.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/mercy_break/devlog/inventory.png" title="Inventory" class="pic"
                onclick="openLightboxSimple(this)">
        </div>

        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <div>
                <p>
                    Now it came to building the level. For the foliage I used assets from the asset store.
                    Every other asset you see is done in Blender and textured in Substance Painter.
                    I created different sets of models for various parts of the game, such as furniture, street
                    accessoires, construction site, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To build the buildings, I split walls into 3x3m sections.
                    I created various modular models in Blender and used Unreal's construction scripts to create a
                    flexible, modular system.
                    You can build windows, doors, roofs, pillars, etc.
                    Special measures were taken to ensure that there was
                    absolutely no z-fighting. Once a building was done it was saved as a static mesh. I then added
                    furniure and spawn
                    points for the loot and saved everything in a Blueprint.
                </p>
                <p>Now you could just choose a building and drag and
                    drop it into the scene. Amazing!</p>

        <h2>The future</h2>
        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p>
                While I do consider this project done, there were some Updates in development which never saw the light of day.
                The biggest update to the game being a co-op zombie mode. You can play it with 1-8 players and face waves of zombie hordes swarming your settlement.
                It comes with a new map called 'Mercy Settlement', a barricaded settlement facing extinction because of the zombies.
                There are three enemy types: The Grunt, The Sprinter and The Armored, which will shoot at you!
                To better defend yourself I also added a new weapon! A semi-auto shotgun.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="flexcontainer">
            <p>
                Trough competing in the zombie mode you earn credits, which you can then spend on customization options.
                You can customize you character and your weapons. I added a shop UI to the game where you can preview, purchase and equip cosmetic items.
